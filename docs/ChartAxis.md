# `ui5.viz.ChartAxis`
The <code>ChartAxis</code> control: ChartAxis container for bar, line and other chart types. Based on C3.js..

**Extends**: [sap.ui.core.Element](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Element) This module inherits all methods and attributes from the extended module and from all other modules in the inheritence hierarchy.

## Sample Usage (XML View)
This element must be used with the <code>ui5.viz.Chart</code> control and was designed to work best in XML views and in combination with data binding.
```xml
<Chart>
  <!-- tbd -->
</Chart>
```
